Shablona is a template project for small scientific python projects. 

## Organizing your project

The project has the following structure: 

shablona - 
		  |- `setup.py`
		  |- `README.md`
		  |- `LICENSE` 
		  |- doc
		  	|- `Makefile`
			|- `conf.py`
			|- sphinxext
				|- ... 
		  	|- _static 
				|- ...
		  |- shablona
		  	|- `__init__.py`
			|- `shablona.py`
		  	|- data
				|- ...
			|- tests
				|- ...

In the following sections we will examine these elements one by one. First, let's consider the core of the project. This is the code inside of `shablona/shablona.py`. This code is intentionally rather simple.

It's not too important to know what it does, but if you are really interested, you can read all about it [here](http//arokem.github.io/2014-08-12-learn-optimization.html)
