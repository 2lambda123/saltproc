## MSBR Model

Based on the design paper by Robertson, 1971

Figure 3.27, pg 46
Figure 3.4, pg 17
Figure 3.5, pg 18
Figure 3.3, pg 16

Model features:
- Simplified Zone IA (graphite element is idential Zone IIA in the model, does not match original paper spec)
- Simplified Zone IIA (graphite element does not match the original spec)
- Simplified Zone IIB (graphite slabs are constructed from cylindrical sectors, and so do not have a consistent width; the last gap in the ccw direction in each octant is smaller than the other gaps, which all have the same dimension)
- Control rod elements (A Guess, as no spec was provided)
- Radial reflectors.
- Simplified axial reflectors (flat and cover more than what the MSBR does)

Missing from model:
- Zone IB
- Top part of core (filled with salt?)
- Radial reflector axial ribs
- Radial reflector retaining rings
- Upper salt plenum
- Zone IIB Graphite Dowel pins and Hastelloy N eliptical pins
- Salt inlets and outlest
- Top and bottom dished heads
- Zone I eliptical graphite sealing pins
